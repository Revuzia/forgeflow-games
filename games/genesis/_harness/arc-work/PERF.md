# PERF ledger (performance engineer, 2026-11-10) — owner: "keep the high quality but ensure the game isnt so choppy"

Rules: never lower a preset (resolution, DPR, shadows, range, density, effects). Fix causes. Bulky output: _harness/scratch/arc/perf/.
Probe: _harness/arc-work/perf-play.mjs (built game, static server, Playwright SwiftShader; GL call counters + perfmon + CPU profile).

## STATUS
- Session 1 (05:3xZ): probe written, nothing measured. Session 2: probe fixed + first numbers + the main GPU finding
  below. The container restarts often (3 times so far): every run must be restarted through slot.sh.
- Probe usage that WORKS (one cell takes 10-15 min under SwiftShader with load 5; never run two probes at once, the GPU
  process starves and GL calls block for seconds):
  `_harness/slot.sh node _harness/arc-work/perf-play.mjs --dist=_harness/scratch/arc/perf/dist0 --quality=high
   --size=888x500 --scenes=town,region --speeds=1 --frames=24 --settle=12 --gl=1 --profile=1 --passes=1 --extra=seed=1234
   --save=_harness/scratch/arc/perf/world25.gnss --shot=_harness/scratch/arc/perf/shots/NAME --out=...json`
  (`--extra=seed=1234` makes the save load in place; without it the page reloads. `--passes=1` = finish() at every
  framebuffer switch, SwiftShader ms per render target. The save is a 15-year world: 749 people, 33 settlements, 1671
  buildings; rebuild it with `node _harness/arc-work/perf-world25.ts 25 <out>` (~10 min, git-ignored, lost on restart
  only if scratch is wiped). `perf-ext.mjs` lists the WebGL extensions of the headless Chromium.)

## MEASUREMENTS
- Fresh world, High 888x500, orbit, 1x, panning (44 frames): 43 draw calls, 362 k triangles, 24 useProgram, 146 uniform
  calls, 400 state calls per frame; buffer uploads 1.5 MB/frame mean with ONE frame of 30 MB (terrain patches after a
  camera cut); texture uploads 1.1 MB/frame; snapshots: clone p95 1.0 ms, apply p95 5.5 ms, max 7.9 ms (88 messages) —
  the snapshot path is NOT a hitch source at 1x. JS self time per frame is small (updateMatrixWorld 0.6, terrain
  buildGeometry 0.5, GC 2.9 ms/frame mean). Wall time under SwiftShader is all bufferData / texSubImage2D blocking on the
  software GPU process, which says nothing about a real GPU.
- BUSY WORLD, TOWN CLOSE-UP (15 y, High 888x500, speed 0, no input, 30 frames settled then 10 measured, step-1 build
  with zcons on; `z1.log`): 270 draw calls, **3.85 M triangles per frame** — shadows 149 calls / **2.40 M tris**, scene
  75 calls / 1.24 M tris, water 9 calls; 380 terrain patches + 134 water patches; 63 useProgram, 497 uniform calls.
  SwiftShader ms per render target (finish() at each switch): scene+water+fx target 6606, shadow atlas 2240, canvas
  (final FXAA) 53, ALL other passes together (GTAO, clouds, atmosphere, bloom, exposure...) < 5. So the cost is the
  geometry passes, not the full-screen effects. (SwiftShader shades on 4 CPU threads: relative numbers only.)
  STILL STREAMING after 40 frames at rest: 263 bufferData calls / 9.1 MB and 29 texture uploads / 10.3 MB per frame,
  perfmon `planets` slot 172 ms/frame of main-thread JS (this box under load 5; maybe a fifth of that on a Mac): the
  terrain builds patchBudget = 16 patches per frame ON THE MAIN THREAD, a count budget, not a time budget. Snapshot
  path: clone p95 1.8 ms, apply p95 2.7, max 5.2 ms (51 messages): not a hitch source.

## FINDING 1 (largest GPU cause, by reading the code): NO EARLY DEPTH TEST ANYWHERE
`renderer.ts:179` creates the WebGLRenderer with `logarithmicDepthBuffer: true`. three then makes EVERY material's
fragment shader write `gl_FragDepth` (chunk logdepthbuf_fragment). A shader that writes depth cannot be depth-tested
before it runs: the GPU shades every fragment of every triangle, hidden or not (on Apple GPUs it also switches off the
tile renderer's hidden-surface removal). So the 1900-line terrain shader runs in full under every tree, house, grass
blade and person, and every tree crown behind another is shaded in full with 3-cascade shadow lookups. Cost grows with
how much is on screen — exactly the owner's report. Estimated overdraw in a town / forest view 3-6x.
Fix candidates (neither lowers anything; both keep the image):
 a. CONSERVATIVE DEPTH (chosen first; the image is identical by construction, every depth decoder stays as it is):
    keep gl_FragDepth = log depth, declare it `layout(depth_greater)` (EXT_conservative_depth) and make the rasterised
    depth a LOWER BOUND of the log depth: log depth is convex in 1/w, so its tangent at a reference distance w0 is a
    plain projective depth A + B/w that is <= the log depth everywhere and equal at w0. gl_Position.z = (2A-1)w - 2S with
    K = logDepthBufFC/2, L0 = K log2(1+w0), S = K w0^2 / (ln2 (w0+1)), A = L0 + S/w0 - margin. w0 must be constant per
    triangle: the object's (or instance's) origin depth. Needs EXT_depth_clamp (the tangent goes negative close to the
    camera) — both extensions exist in Chrome/ANGLE Metal and in SwiftShader; without them the old path stays.
    All materials include three's logdepthbuf chunks, so the change is central (override ShaderChunk.logdepthbuf_*).
    The bound is tight only near w0 (a fragment at 2 w0 is culled by occluders nearer than ~1.6 w0), so terrain needs a
    per-patch reference (BatchedMesh per LOD level) and terrain should draw LAST among the opaques.
 b. REVERSED-Z float depth (three `reversedDepthBuffer`, EXT_clip_control): full early-Z and Apple HSR, but ~40 edits
    (every depth decode, sky test `d >= 0.999999`, unprojection with clip z = -1, Frustum.setFromProjectionMatrix, the
    custom SunShadows compare, starfield z) with a dual path for browsers without the extension. Larger and riskier.

## OTHER GPU COSTS (analytic, High preset; pixels = canvas x min(dpr, 1.5)^2: 888x500 -> 1.0 MP, 1600x900 -> 3.2 MP)
- shadows: 3 cascades (1024^2 each in a 2048 atlas), every caster drawn again per cascade, every frame.
- scene: terrain (heaviest shader) + buildings + vegetation (alpha test) + crowds, all with shadow lookups; no early-Z.
- GTAO half-res (2 slices x 6 steps); 2 full-screen copies for the water; the water sheet (SSR reprojection).
- clouds: quarter of the pixels marched per frame (48 steps x 5 light steps) + a full-res resolve (25 taps).
- atmosphere composite: full-res, 16 steps; then keepPrevious copy, god rays, bloom chain, tonemap, FXAA (4 more
  full-res passes). About 8 full-screen RGBA16F passes per frame in all.

## FIXES
- F1 (IN PROGRESS, code landed, compiles, NOT yet verified in the browser): conservative log depth.
  `src/render/shaders/zcons.ts` (overrides three's logdepthbuf chunks; `enableConservativeDepth` called in the Renderer
  constructor; `depthClamp(r, false/true)` around the sun-shadow pass), switch `?zcons=0` = old path. Default reference
  distance = object / instance origin; a material may `#define GENESIS_ZREF <per-triangle-constant expr>`.
  Verification running: `_harness/scratch/arc/perf/run-z.sh` -> z1.log / z0.log (+ shots/z1-town.png, z0-town.png,
  -region): must show 0 console errors, equal pictures, and the hdr-target pass ms (SwiftShader) with and without.
  If a shader fails to compile with the #extension line, see zcons.ts shaderSource patch.
  Step 2 (code landed, compiles, NOT yet in a verified build): (a) terrain + water sheet use an EDGE bound instead of a
  tangent (`#define GENESIS_ZEDGE (3.0 * uMorph.z + 2.0)` in terrainvert.glsl.ts; zcons.ts: exact vertex log depth minus
  the chord error K (e/(w-e))^2 * 1.5/(8 ln2); slack ~8 cm at 100 m) — the terrain is one object, a single tangent would
  not reject it under trees; (b) buildings: `GENESIS_ZREF` = the building's own origin (buildingmat.ts); (c) terrain
  batches `renderOrder = 50` (chunks.ts PatchBatch) so the ground is drawn after trees / houses / people.
  Step-1 build = _harness/scratch/arc/perf/dist1 (runs z1 / z0); step-2 needs a new build (dist2) and the same run.
  Still loose (valid, just less rejection): merged meshes whose origin is the planet centre (paved roads, far
  groundcover), particles. Vegetation, crowds, animals, boats, camps use instanceMatrix: per-instance tangent by default.
